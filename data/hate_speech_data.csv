Don’t let Israel gaslight you into thinking this began on October 7th..,-1
Israel helped Gaza 2005!!! Your lies are no longer relevant...after 7.10 we just started to show you what Israel is!!!!,1
@kotayba_musleh I agree it became when the arabs came and tried to conquer a land they had no right too,1

CNN didn’t get the videos from the main markets full in gaza full with food? 🧐,1

I can no longer hear about so much horror against Palestinians.,-1
"So there is no famine ?? I thought for the past several months, everyone has been starving in Gaza. This despite hundreds of aid trucks entering everyday and videos of Gazans posting to social media with tons of food. But @cnn - I get it, journalim is hard for you guys. It’s so easy to dunk their lies. Activism is easier.",1
This is what Zionism is,-1
Praying 🙏🏾 for he people of 🇵🇸,-1
Stop reporting lies! The UN said there are sufficient evidence that there is more then needed aid crossing in to Gaza if Hamas wouldn’t steal and kill its own people for food then there will be no famine!!!!,1
Crimes against humanity..Funded by the US.,-1
"Every single day since October 8, you guys have been saying that there was a famine and a hunger crisis. Can you report the actual correct thing? Maybe it’s time to start blaming Hamas for putting the people of Gaza in the situation.",1
Can they just return all the hostages so this can end?,0
And yet markets are up and running in Gaza 😂😂😂,1
Well if HAMAS would stop stealing the aid being sent and then making the people buy it back.. maybe there wouldn’t be a famine. Hamas is responsible for the destruction of Palestine and that is what the pro Palestine protestors have supported.,1
Stop this f**king bs!!!!! Stop spreading false information!! Hamas is stealing the aid. There is more than enough food in Gaza to feed x3 the population.,1
Explain to me how this isn't genocide,-1
Israel sends in aid daily. Daily!!! There a records of it with the UN. Daily for the last 8 months. Hamas takes the aid and hoards it or sells it. But you refuse to ensure people know this. You want to paint Israel with this evil brush. It’s such irresponsible reporting. And downright dangerous.,1

"Funny, Israel defending itself isn’t a war crime. Where are the hostages? Or is that not a war crime? The UN is discussing.",1

Bad reporting. You only stated the number killed by Hamas. What about the multiple tens of thousands killed by Israel?? Shame on you.,-1
It’s not a war. It’s an OCCUPATION vs RESISTANCE. I wish yall would call it what it is. GENOCIDE.,-1

Lmao they’re protesting for people who have American hostages. They’d turn you into farm food for their cattle lol,1
Seems like people like to hop on trends what’s good protesting here in America? Ain’t nothing gonna happen here go to the Middle East and protest there you wouldn’t even last a hour you’re supporting people who hate you and wouldn’t think twice about ending your life how about you protest the homeless/ mentally disabled veterans who get treated like shi who fought for your country how about you protest bidens disaster high gas prices sky rocketing inflation sending aid to other countries with our money and we have to pay a price for it America needs to get it together at this moment thousands and thousands of undocumented people are coming to our country and being taken care of while we struggle especially un 💉 lol while they made you get it there are also military aged men flowing in throughout the country we live in a 3rd world right now it’s sad to say,1
"Looks like Insurrectionists to me, it’s not protests when they are getting violent. They are ANTI-SEMITICS!",1
Thank you for showing the truth. The brutality and antisemitism that came out in LA this weekend can’t be tolerated.,1
This isn’t a protests this is just hate on full display!!!,1
Stop saying “pro Palestine” when they are just “anti Jew.” If they were pro Palestine they’d protest the way Hamas and the PLO have destroyed generations of Palestinians’ hope for a better future living in peace with the Jewish State.,1
Blocking a Synagogue and chasing Jews with bats in Los Angeles is all about “Palestine” right?,1
Thank you for reporting on this accurately. 🙏 this was a progron not a protest. It’s terrorism on US soil and it’s time we wake up,1
"They didn’t just “block access”. They went on an assault and vandalism spree, and openly hunted for anyone with a Jewish appearance prior to people rushing to defense. There is zero moral equivalence here in movement or behavior. This was a not a “clash.” There are no “sides” here, and this isn’t football, this is an antisemitic mob that for some reason people are giving an alarming amount of behavioral rope to.",1
Blocking entrance to a place of worship? This is really a new low.,1
Stop the anti-Semitism!!! 🇺🇸🇮🇱,1
This is how the 🇺🇸 supports terror by tolerating such events. This is not freedom of speech! This is anti-Semitism!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
Thank you for bringing attention to antisemitism.,1
Just say it- antisemitism. It's truly heartbreaking.,1
Absolutely horrible that something like this can take place in 🇺🇸 and people can't condemn it!!! It's giving Germany 1930's😥,1
"This was not a “protest” or a “clash” it was a pogrom. Just example 1,000,000 of how anti-Zionism is in fact, anti-semitism. For the record, this is exactly what happened in Europe in the years leading up to the Holocaust, so no, your Jewish friends and neighbors are not overreacting.",1
"Attacking our places of worship will not bring peace, but makes the USA a place where Jews feel unsafe.",1
This is horrific! Stop antisemitism!,1
Yeah I think those protesters forfeited their American values when they decided to use antisemitism to help Palestine,1
Thank you for calling out the antisemitism and terrorism on American soil. Thank you WSJ for accurately reporting the hate fueled attack on Jews that this pro Hamas rally was.,1
Thank you WSJ for taking the time to accurately report the abhorrent antisemitism the Jewish community is experiencing now.,1
Don’t vote Hamas maybe your future will be better,1
and who slammed that door shut again on Oct 7th?,1
I wonder what kfir and Ariel Bibas think of their childhood? Not even one and taken hostage 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱,1
Blame h@mas,1
Why is there no mention of Hamas in the graphics or social copy here? That’s the reason there will never be coexistence with Israelis… because of Hamas.,1
No mention of Hamas? 🧐,1
"I don’t get it. Palestinians overwhelmingly support Hamas, who decided to start a war. Don’t blame Israel now that they are defending themselves and fighting to get back the hostages",1
"Perhaps instead of demonizing Israel (which is giving the most care and aid to the Gazans out of any neighbor in the region), the WSJ should think about showing the Western audience who is chiefly responsible for this suffering. Perhaps living under the governance of a terror organization, no matter how dependent on it the people may be, is a recipe for oppression and warfare?",1
She can thank Hamas for that,1
Dont vote for Hamas?,1
Shame on the wsj for publishing this one sided and hateful article. Am Yisrael chai 🇮🇱,1
Hamas ruined her life,1
I know for a fact I’ll never see my friends again- they were brutally murdered on October 7th.,1
"For everyone blaming this young lady and trying to mention hamas in each comment , go educate yourself about the conflict that has been there for 75 years , Palestinians in west bank also have same coexistence crisis although there is no hamas in west bank",-1
Maybe if Oct 7th didn’t happen they’d be better off? Just a thought,1
Gen Zs should be angry with Hamas for denying them a future.,1
Dare to demand responsibility from Hamas who caused this situation and stole foreign aid from Gazan people. No other nation received so much aid than the Palestinians. You cannot blame Israel and Jews for their failiures!,1
She can blame hamas and Iran for that,1
"Only Muslim are victims of violence, but Hindus being killed by Muslims in Kashmir and Jews on Oct 7 are not victims who deserve media coverage.",1
So much hate & dehumanisation of Palestinians in the comments. We can guess who reads wsj.,-1
Lol why is this comment section o much prozionist lol hhhhhh,-1
"And you are raised to hate the only 2 nations that do try to help 🇺🇸🇮🇱 if not you would be starving, blame your leaders",1
"Palestinians have been massacred, occupied, oppressed and ethnically cleansed for 75 years. Why? Because they didn’t hand their lands over to Jewish immigrants from Europe. That’s it. That’s what it comes down to. No matter how you spin it, that is the ultimate truth no one can deny",-1
Shame on you WSJ. Not surprising though. Maybe they should invest in a future that does not include murdering their neighbors!!!! 70 years of waste. Am Israel Chai. 🇮🇱 🇮🇱 🇮🇱,1
"Hope? They had hope, alright. They hoped to murder their neighbours and destroy a nation. They keep losing every war they start and then complain they’ve ’lost all hope’. Maybe they should change what they hope for.",1
Goodness me. I’m guessing this is Israels fault too? 🤷🏻‍♀️,1
Must be Israel’s fault,1
Don't forget to blame the Hebrews 😂🥲,1
I am surprised Jews aren't being blamed for the extreme heat yet but members of extreme left Pale-cult are already linking Zionism to eco-supremacy so it is just around the corner,1
This will end up Israel’s fault too,1
Are jews responsible??,1
"Not even a kilo from his weight lost, he looks healthy and good, neither look at released prisoners from idf jails.",-1
@huma.nkindness being kidnapped sounds amazing!!! The cake is the cherry on top!! Imagine you hate Jews so much you glamorize their kidnapping.,1
"Israel hostages look healthy & well fed but if Palestinian prisoners were released. They look starved, a sign of torture and many more",-1
@immamonsta.inc and that justifies the peaceful and friendly kidnapping. I’m sure their mental state is wonderful too. The prisoners you have mentioned are terrorists not civilians… so don’t make a full of yourself by comparing the two.,1
"@immamonsta.inc sinwar looks just fine! He was a Palestinian prisoner (convicted of killing 4 Palestinians 😱) and while in prison, he complained of headaches, so an Israeli doctor found that he had a terminal brain tumor, operated on him, saved his life, then he was released in a prisoner exchange for one IDF soldier taken hostage .. his release led to Oct 7th. Israel always chooses life.. even operating on a monster instead of letting him suffer from his condition and die . Try again. !",1
"@agattini the majority of prisoners Israel have taken are under 16. Children charged with the crime of throwing rocks at tanks. Some of these children have been released after years, they show signs of extreme starvation and torture. These are the facts, no opinion nor narrative.",-1
Well these Hostages look well treated compared to the Palestinian Hostages Israel holds..,-1
"That’s insane! These 4 people newsworthy right? More than 200 people were killed meanwhile as you mentioned but they have no names, they are just numbers!",-1
Rescue mission with over 200 civilians as collateral damage. 🙄,-1
"They look look well and like they were taken care of, unlike those images and videos of dead Palestinian babies with their body parts hanging out that will haunt me forever. I’m glad they are free but one persons life is not greater than anothers. The way this was done will go down in history as genocide.",-1
He looks healthy and well taken care of. Unlike those poor Palestinian civilians,-1
And how many did IDF killed?,-1
Kills hundreds to save 4. Sounds like something Homelander would do.,-1
Why were innocent Palestinian civilians trying to stop the IDF soldiers that were there to rescue 4 civilian hostages? Why were they captivating these hostages in their homes to begin with?,1
Israël is doing everything to save their people! Congrats rescuing these 4 people 💙💙💙,1
Well done! Hamas must become a distant memory,1
Badass. Thank you IDF.,1
IDF soldiers are heroes. God bless IDF and ISRAEL,1

It’s funny that they sometimes refer to Hamas as “PALESTINIAN HEALTH OFFICIALS”,1
"Rafah massacre is a mistake, targeting of the World Central Kitchen staff was a mistake, the flower massacre was a mistake, Hamas main operation base under Al Shifa hospital was a mistake, targeting of the Orthodox Church was a mistake, killing of over 100 journalists was a mistake, killing of 15,000 students was a mistake. What other mistakes does Israel have planned? When do we ever get to see any of the investigations you claim are undergoing?",-1
The comments on here = ignorance. 😮 8 months of gen0cide and people are still making snarky comments.,-1
I just don't see this kids flying to Palestine and fight for their freedom. Maybe support a local cause?,1
Supporting terrorism is NOT free speech!,1
Have these protestors not seen the tragedies that occurred on October 7th? Do they not realize there are still over 100 hostages held by Hamas? I really don’t understand the logic,1
I find it funny how people think rioting on college campuses will cause peace in nations on the other side of the world.,1
😑 our best and brightest don't even know what they're fighting for,1
There must be protests in free Palestine from Hamas right😂 do they realize Hamas would kill most of them for being educated or dress a certain way or played certain music? I think they need to learn more about Hamas.,1

"This is such a disgusting caption - it’s clear from the video that it was the Zionists who wrecked violence on protesters at UCLA. No sane group of people orchestrates such violence & with such impunity - carrying out a full-blown assault using fireworks/explosives.

This situation is becoming unmanageable. It is important to keep political matters out of educational institutions.,0
"These comments are terrifying. There are Jewish voices there too. Many people do not support Netanyahu, even his own people, while they condemn the attacks on Israel. But this war is a genocide in the making. That is the problem… where are people critical thinking skills and where is the empathy for human lives. Including the pain of these students. We cannot silence voices.",1

All the victims in Majdal Shams are between 9 and 20 years old. Some sources write that the Druze have already announced that they will not leave the Hezbollah attack without consequences. I note that until recently, the Druze of the Golan Heights considered themselves exclusively Syrians and even sent their children there to study. In recent years, the situation has begun to change and many have accepted Israeli citizenship. However, they continue to maintain close ties with the Druze community in Syria, where over 800 thousand of their brothers live. The Syrian Druze have always been loyal to Assad, but now, on the contrary, they are demonstrating against the Syrian regime. In a word, Hezbollah carried out this attack in vain. It can lead to serious consequences.

The world/international community is still blind, deaf and dumb towards Israel.

"Shalom,
Today’s ter*rorist attack by H*izbullah ter*rorists that targeted #MajdałShams football field in Northern Israel, in a Druze community, ended up mur*dering over 12  children & injured others, proved that the so called “resistance” wing targets anyone inside Israel 🇮🇱, be it Jew, Muslim or Druze, old or young, that included H*outhis ter*rorists who in their last attack targeted a civilian building in Tel Aviv, & not to forget H*amas ter*rorists who invaded Israel on October 7th, mur*dering not only men & women, but even children.
I hope & wish for the silent world to break its silence & support #Israel 🇮🇱 in the wake of this massacre, & hold Iranian 🇮🇷 regime accountable for its crimes.
My family & I, send our condolences to the families of the victims, may their memory be a blessing.

Hezbollah drone explodes in Druze village, many wounded, some are hopeless.

Around half past six in the evening, a drone launched from Lebanon exploded on a sports field in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights.

Majd al Shams in northern Israel. A direct hit by a rocket on the stadium. At the moment, 10 people are dead and dozens are wounded. Some of the victims are children and teenagers.

The world/international community is still blind, deaf and dumb towards Israel.

"Oliver, like many others alike, are trying to save Israel (a settler colonial entity, an apartheid state) by throwing Netanyahu and his gang under the bus. It is not BB, Smotrich, or Ben-Gvir, it is the whole Zionist ideology which has to go for us to  have peace in Palestine.",-1
"Never Again does not mean that Jews will not fight wars if attacked. We learned last time.

"I've heard ""Nakba"" described more often as a genocidal attempt by the Arabs to wipe out the fledgling Jewish state that went wrong.

And that Judea and Samaria (called the ""West Bank"" by the Islamic colonizers) are lands that have been inhabited by the Jewish people for thousands of years.

Did I get this right?",1
"Correct; Nakba can be roughly translated as ""Fucked Around, Found Out, And Never Stopped Crying Victim"".

And BTW, if the borders of Israel as established in 1948 are illegitimate, then so are ALL the borders of all the Levant countries established after WWI. Be consistent.",1
"There are two MILLION Palestinians living successfully in Israel (out of 10M pop). Doctors, lawyers, the whole gamut of success. You'd rather have the kid’s rocks turn into grenades, eh?

"Israel is an apartheid state that is even bigoted against its own citizens. If you were born in Russia, a European Israeli thinks he's more important than you.

Keep Zionists away from your history books.

"As a Christian I just want to use this opportunity to thank Muslims who have shown sincere respect and veneration for Jesus Christ. You made your voices heard more than many Christians as Christ was mocked and blasphemed for all to see. The Christian world needs to realize who our allies are, and who the ones are who hate Christ and Christianity. The group that shall not be named, apart from the “chosen” ones, are the driving the force behind denigrating Christ because of their open hatred for Him and His followers. Yet, many Christians will bend backwards to be their goy and even deny Christ to please the “chosen” people. I also thank the non-religious friends here on X who show more love and respect for the Christian faith than many within the church. That makes you my brothers and sisters.

Why is Hezbollah tolerated by the intl community? Why is it appeased? If the intl community had done more about Hezbollah, the twelve children in Majdal Shams would be alive today.",1
